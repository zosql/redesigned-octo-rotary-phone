-- 1.Some sample queries

SELECT order_ref, line_no, ol_style, ol_size, ol_material
 FROM order_line

-- Result:

-- 2.A sample join:

SELECT order_ref, line_no, fabric, colour, pattern, cost
  FROM order_line, material
 WHERE ol_material = material_no

-- Result:
order_ref	line_no	fabric	colour	pattern	cost
1	1	Silk	Black	Plain	7
1	2	Silk	Red Abstract	Printed	10
2	1	Cotton	Yellow Stripe	Woven	3
2	2	Cotton	Green Stripe	Woven	3
2	3	Cotton	Black Dotted	...

-- 3.To get a description of the garment we need to join the garment table. The join condition is that the ol_style in order_line matches the style_no in garment.

SELECT order_ref, line_no, description
  FROM order_line, garment
 WHERE ol_style = style_no

-- Result:
order_ref	line_no	description
1	1	Trousers
6	1	Trousers
12	4	Trousers
4	1	Trousers
...

-- 4.If we need both the description and the fabric we can join both material and garment to the order_line table. The join conditions are combined with "AND"

SELECT order_ref, line_no, fabric, description
  FROM order_line, material, garment
 WHERE ol_style = style_no
   AND ol_material = material_no

-- Result:
order_ref	line_no	fabric	description
1	1	Silk	Trousers
6	1	Serge	Trousers
12	4	Silk	Trousers
4	1	Polyester	Trousers
10	2	Cotton	Trouser...

-- 5.The quantities table tells us how much material is required for every garment for every size available. The join between the order_line and quantities is unusual in that it involves two fields. This can be seen by the fact that quantities has a composite key.

SELECT order_ref, line_no, quantity
  FROM order_line, quantities
 WHERE ol_style = style_q
   AND ol_size  = size_q

-- Result:
order_ref	line_no	quantity
1	1	2.7
6	1	2.7
12	4	2.7
4	1	2.8
10	2	3
...

-- 6.Customers place orders - each order contains many lines - each line of the order refers to a garment:

SELECT c_name, order_date, order_no, line_no
   FROM jmcust, dress_order, order_line
  WHERE          jmcust.c_no = dress_order.cust_no
  AND   dress_order.order_no = order_line.order_ref

-- Result:
c_name	order_date	order_no	line_no
Mrs Peacock	Thu, 10 Jan 2002 00:00:00 GMT	1	1
Mrs Peacock	Thu, 10 Jan 2002 00:00:00 GMT	1	2
Dr Green	Fri, 11 Jan 2002 00:00:00 GMT	2	1
Dr Green	Fri, 11 Jan 2002 00:00:00 ...

-- 7.There's also a dress maker table, and a table called construction which gives you information about who made which order and when:

SELECT d_no, d_name, construction.order_ref, construction.line_ref, start_date, finish_date
 FROM dressmaker, order_line, construction
 WHERE  d_no=maker  
 AND order_line.order_ref=construction.order_ref 
 AND order_line.line_no=construction.line_ref

-- Result:
d_no	d_name	order_ref	line_ref	start_date	finish_date
