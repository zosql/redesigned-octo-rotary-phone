-- this also makes sense since the Supplier is not linked with any customer which would be the case if the supplier were to deliver to the customer directly.

-- we will work with the assumption that return stock value adds to the capital stock value
-- what's already in the stock is capital stock value base
-- shipped queries are decreases in TCSV
-- expected deliveries from suppliers adds to the TCV
-- this is the same logic as was applied for Q2 for calculatin final stock
-- TCSV is juts multiplying it with the value of the products that day with their per product price
-- this is unlike keilOrg who took "purchases" or sales as total capital stock value which does not make sense.

-- 5.Obtain a list of discrepancies in the stock levels

-- Starting with the assumption that this means the inventory or stock level was counted wrongly when it was actually counted.
-- This is different from Q2 where the idea was to count everything till date: ie last stock chk + returned - shipped + deliveries from supplier
-- The assumption of the Q2 was that the last stock check was correct for each product, however now it is to doubt or question that!

-- Keil org is using sales data to find stock discrepancy which seems like a mistake since receipt of orders does not affect stocks!
