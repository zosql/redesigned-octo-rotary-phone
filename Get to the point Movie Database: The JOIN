--Joining two tables
1. Join casting and actor on actorid/id

SELECT * FROM casting JOIN actor
          ON casting.actorid=actor.id
  WHERE actor.name='John Hurt'

--Joining three tables
2. Then it makes sense to join the above table with the movie table. The obvious field to join on is the movieid field.

SELECT * FROM
   movie JOIN casting ON movie.id=movieid
         JOIN actor   ON actorid=actor.id
  WHERE actor.name='John Hurt'
