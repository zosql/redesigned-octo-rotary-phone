-- Specify a date
-- 1.The Standard specifies a date literal as: DATE '1982-05-20'
-- Similarly specify a timestamp using TIMESTAMP '1982-05-20 21:30:00'
-- Find the songs played on 20th May 1982.

SELECT * FROM totp
 WHERE wk = DATE '1982-05-20'

-- Match a range of dates
-- 2.The BETWEEN clause may be used with dates, numbers and strings

SELECT *FROM totp
where wk between '1980-04-01' and '2020-04-01'

-- 3.We want to know how long has it been since Tom Jones featured on TOTP.

SELECT singer, max(2024-04-01-Date_Format(wk,'%Y-%m-%d')) Years FROM totp
where singer ='Tom Jones'
group by singer 
order by Years Desc

-- INTERVAL of time
-- 4.We can add (or subtract) a number of days (or years, months, hours, minutes or seconds) from date.
-- In this example we want to find the totp events that went out in the week of my birthday.

-- SECOND (4 days)
SELECT * FROM totp
WHERE DATE '1992-05-30'
 BETWEEN wk - INTERVAL '345600' Second
     AND wk + INTERVAL '345600' Second

-- Result:
wk	singer	song
Thu, 28 May 1992 00:00:00 GMT	Cure	Friday Im In Love
Thu, 28 May 1992 00:00:00 GMT	Lisa Stansfield	Set Your Loving Free

-- HOUR (could be MINUTE, Year, Month)
SELECT * FROM totp
WHERE DATE '1992-05-30'
 BETWEEN wk - INTERVAL '100' HOUR
     AND wk + INTERVAL '100' HOUR

-- Date functions
-- Group by day of the week (using date functions)
-- 5.We might want to count, or find the average by days of the week. This approach uses the date functions.
-- In this example we note that top of the pops usually goes out on a Thursday or Friday.

SELECT DAYOFWEEK(wk), COUNT(song)
  FROM totp
 GROUP BY DAYOFWEEK(wk)

-- Date arithmetics
-- Group by day of the week (using arithmetic).
-- 6.We can use modular arithmetic to calculate the day of the week.
-- We happen to know that 20 May 1962 was a Sunday. We calculate the number of days from that day and take mod 7 value. This tells us the day of the week: 0 is Sunday, 1 is Monday...

select *, dayofweek(wk) from totp

-- Result:
wk	singer	song	dayofweek(wk)
Wed, 27 Nov 1974 00:00:00 GMT	David Essex	Gonna Make You A Star	4
Wed, 27 Nov 1974 00:00:00 GMT	Gary Glitter	Oh Yes Youre Beautiful	4

-- Result tells us that Wed is 4th dotw hence Sunday is 0.

-- Select the oldest TOTP entry
-- 7.How can I select the oldest TOTP Singers in the table by date of release?

select singer from 
where wk=
select min(wk) from totp

-- Select a record with the latest date
-- 8.There may be several records with the same date.
-- There are two steps...
-- (a) Find the latest date
-- (b) Select records with that date
-- With a nested select we can do both of these in one go.

select singer, wk from totp
where wk=
(select MAX(wk) from totp)

-- Result:
singer	wk
Janet Jackson	Fri, 04 Aug 2000 00:00:00 GMT
Moloko	Fri, 04 Aug 2000 00:00:00 GMT
Santana	Fri, 04 Aug 2000 00:00:00 GMT

-- YYYYMMDD date format
-- How to format a date in the like yyyymmdd.
-- 9. Display the dates that Madness played Top of the Pops, show the dates in the format yyyymmdd.

select singer, wk, date_format(wk,'%Y%m%d') from totp
where singer = 'Madness'

-- Result:
singer	wk	date_format(w..
