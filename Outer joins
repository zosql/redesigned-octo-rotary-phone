-- 1.All MSPs and parties, including parties with no MSPs, but not MSPs with no parties.

-- if right join then right tabel values survive and are sought in the table on the left
-- if left join then left table values survive and are sought in the table on the right
-- here we don't want to display msps without parties
-- hence we need to preserve the party table and join msps to it

-- where two tables msp and party
-- we want to preserve all values from party table and use right join
-- hence we will mention the table party on the right side of the join code saying: msp right join party on party.code=msp.party

SELECT msp.name, party.name
  FROM msp right JOIN party ON msp.party=party.code

-- right join and left join are outer joins each preserving all the values of the table on the direction it is calling out
