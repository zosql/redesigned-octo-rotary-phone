select name from teacher
where dept is NULL

--2.Note the INNER JOIN misses the teachers with no department and the departments with no teacher.
--SELECT teacher.name, dept.name
--FROM teacher INNER JOIN dept
 --          ON (teacher.dept=dept.id)

name	name

--3.Use a different JOIN so that all teachers are listed.

SELECT teacher.name, dept.name
 FROM teacher left JOIN dept
           ON (teacher.dept=dept.id)

name	name

--4.Use a different JOIN so that all departments are listed.
-- query that misses 1 dept engg

select teacher.name, dept.name 
from dept
join teacher on dept.id=teacher.dept

name	name

-- query that covers engg w/o teacher

select teacher.name, dept.name 
from dept
left join teacher on dept.id=teacher.dept

--5.Use COALESCE to print the mobile number. Use the number '07986 444 2266' if there is no number given. Show teacher name and mobile number or '07986 444 2266'

select name, coalesce (mobile, '07986 444 2266')
from teacher

--6.Use the COALESCE function and a LEFT JOIN to print the teacher name and department name. Use the string 'None' where there is no department.

select teacher.name, coalesce(dept.name,'None') from teacher
left join dept on teacher.dept=dept.id

--7.Use COUNT to show the number of teachers and the number of mobile phones.

select count(teacher.name), count(teacher.mobile)
from teacher

--8.Use COUNT and GROUP BY dept.name to show each department and the number of staff. Use a RIGHT JOIN to ensure that the Engineering department is listed.

--sol1:
select dept.name, count(teacher.name)
from teacher
Right Join dept on dept.id=teacher.dept
group by dept.name

--sol2:
select dept.name, count(teacher.name)
from teacher
Right Join dept on teacher.dept=dept.id
group by dept.name

--9.Use CASE to show the name of each teacher followed by 'Sci' if the teacher is in dept 1 or 2 and 'Art' otherwise.

select teacher.name, 
case
when teacher.dept IN ('1', '2') then 'Sci'
Else 'Art'
End
from teacher

--10. Use CASE to show the name of each teacher followed by 'Sci' if the teacher is in dept 1 or 2, show 'Art' if the teacher's dept is 3 and 'None' otherwise.

select teacher.name,
case 
when teacher.dept IN ('1','2') then 'Sci'
when teacher.dept=3 then 'Art'
Else 'None'
End 
from teacher
