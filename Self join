--1.How many stops are in the database.

select unique(count(name)) from stops

--2.Find the id value for the stop 'Craiglockhart'

select id from stops
where name = 'Craiglockhart'

--3.Give the id and the name for the stops on the '4' 'LRT' service.

select id, name from stops
join route on stops.id=route.stop
where num ='4' and company='LRT'

--Routes and stops
--4.The query shown gives the number of routes that visit either London Road (149) or Craiglockhart (53). 
--Run the query and notice the two services that link these stops have a count of 2. Add a HAVING clause to restrict the output to these two routes.

SELECT company, num, COUNT(*)
FROM route WHERE stop=149 OR stop=53
GROUP BY company, num
Having count(*)=2

--5.Execute the self join shown and observe that b.stop gives all the places you can get to from Craiglockhart, without changing routes. Change the query so that it shows the services from Craiglockhart to London Road.

--sol1:
SELECT a.company, a.num, a.stop, b.stop
FROM route a 
JOIN route b ON (a.company=b.company AND a.num=b.num)
WHERE a.stop=53 and b.stop IN(select id from stops join route on route.stop=stops.id where name='London Road')

--sol2:
SELECT a.company, a.num, a.stop, b.stop
FROM route a 
JOIN route b ON (a.company=b.company AND a.num=b.num)
WHERE a.stop=53 and b.stop=ALL(select id from stops join route on route.stop=stops.id where name='London Road')

--sol3:
SELECT a.company, a.num, a.stop, b.stop
FROM route a 
JOIN route b ON (a.company=b.company AND a.num=b.num)
WHERE a.stop=53 and b.stop=(select distinct(id) from stops join route on route.stop=stops.id where name='London Road')

--6.The query shown is similar to the previous one, however by joining two copies of the stops table we can refer to stops by name rather than by number. 
--Change the query so that the services between 'Craiglockhart' and 'London Road' are shown. 
--If you are tired of these places try 'Fairmilehead' against 'Tollcross'

--sol1:
SELECT a.company, a.num, c.name, d.name
FROM route a 
JOIN route b ON (a.company=b.company AND a.num=b.num)
Join stops c on (a.stop=c.id)
Join stops d on (b.stop=d.id)
WHERE a.stop=(select distinct(id) from stops join route on route.stop=stops.id where name='Fairmilehead')
and b.stop=(select distinct(id) from stops join route on route.stop=stops.id where name='Tollcross')

--sol2:
SELECT a.company, a.num, c.name, d.name
FROM route a 
JOIN route b ON (a.company=b.company AND a.num=b.num)
Join stops c on (a.stop=c.id)
Join stops d on (b.stop=d.id)
WHERE a.stop=53 and b.stop=(select distinct(id) from stops join route on route.stop=stops.id where name='London Road')

--sol3:
SELECT a.company, a.num, c.name, d.name
FROM route a 
JOIN route b ON (a.company=b.company AND a.num=b.num)
