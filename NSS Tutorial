-- 1.The example shows the number who responded for:
-- question 1
-- at 'Edinburgh Napier University'
-- studying '(8) Computer Science'
-- Show the the percentage who STRONGLY AGREE

-- sol1: this gives the smiley however it's not the right answer.
SELECT A_STRONGLY_AGREE
  FROM nss
 WHERE question='Q01'
   AND institution='Edinburgh Napier University'
   AND subject='(8) Computer Science'

-- sol2:this query qctually gives the percentage
select round(sum(response*A_strongly_agree/100)/sum(response)*100)
from nss
 WHERE question='Q01'
   AND subject='(8) Computer Science'
AND institution='Edinburgh Napier University'

-- HINT from Q5
-- The A_STRONGLY_AGREE column is a percentage. 
-- To work out the total number of students who strongly agree you must multiply this number by the number who responded (response) and divide by 100.
-- Take the SUM of that.


-- 2.Show the institution and subject where the score is at least 100 for question 15.

SELECT institution, subject
  FROM nss
 WHERE question='Q15'
   AND score>99

-- Unhappy Computer Students
-- 3.Show the institution and score where the score for '(8) Computer Science' is less than 50 for question 'Q15'

SELECT institution,score
  FROM nss
 WHERE question='Q15'
   AND score<50
   AND subject='(8) Computer Science'

-- More Computing or Creative Students?
-- 4.Show the subject and total number of students who responded to question 22 for each of the subjects '(8) Computer Science' and '(H) Creative Arts and Design'.

SELECT subject,sum(response)
  FROM nss
 WHERE question='Q22'
   AND subject IN ('(8) Computer Science', '(H) Creative Arts and Design')
group by subject

-- Strongly Agree Numbers
-- 5.Show the subject and total number of students who A_STRONGLY_AGREE to question 22 for each of the subjects '(8) Computer Science' and '(H) Creative Arts and Design'.

SELECT subject, sum(A_STRONGLY_AGREE*response/100)
  FROM nss
 WHERE question='Q22'
   AND subject IN ('(8) Computer Science', '(H) Creative Arts and Design')
group by subject

-- Strongly Agree, Percentage
-- 6.Show the percentage of students who A_STRONGLY_AGREE to question 22 for the subject '(8) Computer Science' show the same figure for the subject '(H) Creative Arts and Design'.
-- Use the ROUND function to show the percentage without decimal places.

SELECT subject, round(sum(response*A_strongly_agree/100)/sum(response)*100)
  FROM nss
 WHERE question='Q22'
   AND subject IN ('(8) Computer Science', '(H) Creative Arts and Design')
group by subject

-- Scores for Institutions in Manchester
-- 7. Show the average scores for question 'Q22' for each institution that include 'Manchester' in the name.
-- The column score is a percentage - you must use the method outlined above to multiply the percentage by the response and divide by the total response. Give your answer rounded to the nearest whole number.

SELECT institution, round(sum(response*score/100)/sum(response)*100)
  FROM nss
 WHERE question='Q22'
   AND (institution LIKE '%Manchester%')
Group BY institution
ORDER BY institution

-- Number of Computing Students in Manchester
-- 8.Show the institution, the total sample size and the number of computing students for institutions in Manchester for 'Q01'.

-- operating on the assumption that "computing student" means someone from computer science subject
-- other assumptions, sample is the maximum possible number of responses that could be obtained on any Q, out of which response is what is received
-- Tried sum and count of "sample" when subject is CS but getting 3388 or 1 as responses
-- Additionally the where conditions are not getting applied on this 3rd CS only sample
-- Changing strategy to what I found online to use case when then end which ideally adds columns in the "select" statement

-- part solution 
Select institution, sum(sample), (case when subject='(8) Computer Science' then sample else 0 end) Count
from nss 
where institution LIKE '%Manchester%' and question='Q01'
group by institution

-- the above code gave 46 for as one of the values of the last column but other two remained zero
-- thnking that sum(sample) should be written instead of sample alone.
-- but sample sample gave entire sample size of 537 for this same entry and others remained zero

-- query found online
SELECT institution, sum(sample), sum(case when subject='(8) Computer Science' then sample else 0 end) as comp
  FROM nss
 WHERE question='Q01' AND institution LIKE '%Manchester%'
group by institution

-- this means that to add a column which can be affected by where conditions but  has it's own special condition use case when then end
