-- We will have to build our own ER Diagram.

-- Musicians: easy questions

-- 1.Give the organiser's name of the concert in the Assembly Rooms after the first of Feb, 1997.

select m_name, concert_venue, con_date
from musician
join concert on musician.m_no=concert.concert_orgniser
where concert_venue="Assembly Rooms" and con_date > "1997-02-01"

-- Result:
m_name	concert_venue	con_date
James Steeple	Assembly Rooms	Sat, 20 Sep 1997 00:00:00 GMT

-- 2.Find all the performers who played guitar or violin and were born in England.

select m_name, instrument, place_country
from musician
join performer on musician.m_no=performer.perf_is
join place on place.place_no=musician.born_in
where (instrument= 'guitar' or instrument = 'violin')
and place_country='England'
order by m_name, instrument

-- Result:
m_name	instrument	place_country
Alan Fluff	violin	England
Davis Heavan	guitar	England
Harriet Smithson	violin	England
Harry Forte	violin	England
James First	violin	England
Theo Mengel	violin	England

-- 3.List the names of musicians who have conducted concerts in USA together with the towns and dates of these concerts.

select m_name Musician, place_country Country, place_town Town, date_format(con_date,"%Y-%m-%d") Date
from musician
join concert on musician.m_no=concert.concert_orgniser
join place on place.place_no=concert.concert_in
where place_country='USA'

-- Result:
Musician	Country	Town	Date
James Steeple	USA	New York	1997-06-15

-- 4.How many concerts have featured at least one composition by Andy Jones? List concert date, venue and the composition's title.

-- query attempt 1: progressively written

left join has_composed on has_composed.cmpn_no= composition.c_no -- checked
left join composer on composer.comp_no=has_composed.cmpr_no -- checked
left join musician on musician.m_no=composer.comp_is -- checked
left join concert on musician.m_no=concert.concert_orgniser -- this is a mistake to assume that only when the conductor is the same as composer the composition can be played.
where m_name="Andy Jones"

-- Result:
Count	Date	Venue	c_title	m_name
0	NA	NA	A Simple Piece	Andy Jones

-- query attempt 2: need to join concert but on what?

-- query attempt 4 - since already tried joining performance and composition via band which could very well be that composition in 9 places vs 9 bands.
-- taking another approach of assuming that from the performance table, for every perf no, 
-- there is a band that "gave" that performance by having "performed" a composition, performed in a "concert"
-- so perf table can directly be joined with Novo on c_no but it seems really stupied that c_no = performed = comp_no
